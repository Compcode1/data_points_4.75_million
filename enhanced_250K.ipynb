    "#### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook expands on a previously created novel synthetic dataset of 250,000 rows by inserting additional attributes related to health and lifestyle. The expanded dataset now includes several new columns and computations, offering a richer basis for statistical analysis and machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Enrichment\n",
    "New columns are generated based on a variety of health risk factors, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Smoking Habits**: (Smoker, Former Smoker, Non-Smoker).\n",
    "- **Alcohol Consumption**: (Non-Drinker, Moderate Drinker, Heavy/Binge Drinker).\n",
    "- **Exercise Patterns**: (Meets Both Guidelines, Meets Aerobic Only, Insufficiently Active, Inactive).\n",
    "- **Sleep Deprivation**: (Adequate Sleep, Less than 7 Hours, Chronic Sleep Deprivation).\n",
    "- **Other Health Conditions**: Columns for conditions such as Metabolic Syndrome, COPD, Cancer, Diabetes, and Heart Disease were also included.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Health Condition Assignment\n",
    "Algorithms were designed to assign binary outcomes for a number of health conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Diabetes**: Assigned based on age groups and fasting blood glucose (FBG) thresholds. Younger individuals require higher FBG levels for a diabetes diagnosis, while older individuals have a lower FBG threshold.\n",
    "- **Cancer**: Assigned with a base probability for individuals over 65, with smoking and BMI > 37 as contributing risk factors.\n",
    "- **Heart Disease**: Probability of heart disease is increased by risk factors such as BMI, alcohol consumption, high fasting blood glucose, and smoking.\n",
    "- **Metabolic Syndrome**: Assigned based on the presence of at least three risk factors, including high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL, high fasting blood glucose, and high waist circumference.\n",
    "- **COPD**: Assigned to smokers over age 45, with increased probabilities for smokers over age 60.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Physical Exam Score Calculation\n",
    "A custom **Physical Exam Score** is calculated for each individual, starting with an age-based base score:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base Score**: Determined by age, with younger individuals receiving a higher score.\n",
    "- **Adjustments**: Reductions are applied based on negative health factors like smoking, alcohol consumption, inactivity, sleep deprivation, and conditions like heart disease, cancer, COPD, and diabetes. Each risk factor subtracts a specific percentage from the base score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistical Summaries\n",
    "The notebook computes key statistics, such as the percentage of individuals with diabetes, cancer, COPD, heart disease, and metabolic syndrome. In addition, a breakdown of physical exam scores by age group is provided.\n"

    "2. **Reading the CSV File**:\n",
    "   - If the file exists, it is read into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Saving the Enhanced Dataset**:\n",
    "   - The DataFrame is saved as `enhanced_250K.csv`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Output**:\n",
    "   - If the file is found, a success message is printed.\n",
    "   - If the file is not found, an error message is printed indicating the missing file.\n"

    "This algorithm assigns a **sleep category** (Adequate Sleep, Less than 7 Hours, Chronic Sleep Deprivation) based on the individual's **BMI**, **age**, and **gender**. Probabilities for each sleep category are adjusted based on known patterns in sleep behavior for these demographic groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Base Probabilities**:\n",
    "   - Adequate Sleep (7+ hours): 65%\n",
    "   - Less than 7 Hours: 25%\n",
    "   - Chronic Sleep Deprivation (≤5 hours): 10%\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adjustments Based on Gender**:\n",
    "   - **Men**: Slightly lower chance of getting adequate sleep (60% adequate, 30% less than 7 hours).\n",
    "   - **Women**: Slightly higher chance of getting adequate sleep (70% adequate, 20% less than 7 hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Adjustments Based on Age**:\n",
    "   - **Ages 18-24**: Higher chance of getting adequate sleep (70%).\n",
    "   - **Ages 25-44**: Middle-aged adults have 65% chance of adequate sleep.\n",
    "   - **Ages 45-64**: Older adults have a 60% chance of adequate sleep.\n",
    "   - **Ages 65+**: Seniors have a 60% chance of adequate sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adjustments Based on BMI**:\n",
    "   - **BMI > 30** (Obesity): \n",
    "     - Doubles the probability of getting less than 7 hours of sleep.\n",
    "     - Triples the probability of experiencing chronic sleep deprivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Normalization**:\n",
    "   - Probabilities are normalized to ensure they sum to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Random Assignment**:\n",
    "   - Sleep categories are assigned randomly based on the adjusted probabilities for BMI, gender, and age.\n",

    "#### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook successfully enriched a 250,000-row synthetic dataset with additional health and lifestyle attributes, providing a comprehensive view of various health risk factors across a large population. The key outcomes of this analysis include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accurate Health Condition Assignments**:\n",
    "   - Using age-specific and lifestyle-related thresholds, we assigned binary outcomes for conditions such as **Diabetes**, **Cancer**, **Heart Disease**, **Metabolic Syndrome**, and **COPD**. Each condition was assigned using targeted algorithms based on medical criteria. \n",
    "   - For example, diabetes was assigned based on age-specific FBG thresholds, while cancer assignment relied on age, smoking habits, and BMI.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Physical Exam Score Calculation**:\n",
    "   - A **Physical Exam Score** was computed to quantitatively assess an individual’s overall health. The score starts with a base value determined by age, then adjusts downward for the presence of risk factors such as smoking, inactivity, chronic sleep deprivation, and specific health conditions.\n",
    "   - This score provides a useful single metric for evaluating overall health, and could be employed in further analyses or predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statistical Summaries of Health Conditions**:\n",
    "   - The notebook provided detailed statistics on the prevalence of conditions such as **Diabetes**, **Cancer**, **COPD**, and **Metabolic Syndrome**, breaking down the data by age group and other demographics. These summaries offer a clear picture of the health challenges faced by various population segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this enriched dataset and the analysis performed lay the groundwork for future machine learning applications, especially in predictive modeling for health outcomes. By leveraging the diverse attributes and health metrics, this dataset can be used to build models for predicting the onset of specific health conditions, identifying high-risk populations, and improving public health strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset, stored as **`enhanced_250K.csv`**, serves as a robust foundation for deeper exploration of health-related patterns and potential predictive analytics.\n"
